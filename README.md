## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Backend Setup with Supabase

We use Supabase as our backend database and authentication service. To set up:

1. Create a Supabase account at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Create a new Supabase project
3. Copy your Supabase URL and API keys from the project dashboard
4. Update the `.env` file in the backend directory with your Supabase credentials
5. Install backend dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

6. Initialize the Supabase database:

```bash
node scripts/init-supabase.js
```

7. Start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Supabase Schema

Our application uses the following main tables:
- `universities` - Stores information about registered educational institutions
- `students` - Contains student records linked to universities
- `credentials` - Stores academic credentials with optional blockchain hashing
- `verification_logs` - Tracks all verification requests and results

## Manual Supabase Setup

Supabase differs from Firebase in that it requires a defined database schema. Here's how to set it up:

### Option 1: Using the Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy the contents of `/backend/scripts/schema.sql` 
4. Paste and run this SQL in the Supabase SQL Editor
5. This will create all necessary tables and security policies

### Option 2: Using our setup script (Development only)

The setup script requires the `service_role` key which has higher privileges:

```bash
# Make sure your .env has SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY set
cd backend
npm run setup-db
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Unlike Firebase, Supabase doesn't allow schema creation with the anon key by default. This is for security reasons.

### Testing Your Connection

After setting up the tables, test your API connection:
```
GET http://localhost:5500/api/test-supabase
```

You should see a successful response with data from the health_check table.

üõ†Ô∏è DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR "WHO IS WHO" - EAST AFRICA FOCUS

üìç Phase 1 (MVP): Core Verification System
Timeframe: 2‚Äì3 months
 Goal: Build a working version to onboard East African private universities and reduce credential fraud.
‚úÖ Features to Build:
University Admin Portal
- Login (with role-based access)
- Upload student credential records (CSV or form)
- Support for East African credential formats and naming conventions
- Multi-language support (English, Swahili)
- Dashboard with recent uploads and request logs
- Offline capability for regions with unstable internet

Verifier Portal (Employers / Institutions)
- Public search interface to verify credentials (by student name, ID, year, university)
- Instant result (Match / No Match)
- Mobile-friendly interface (essential for East Africa's mobile-first adoption)

Audit Logs
- Track who verified what, when, and how often
- Compliance with East African data protection regulations

Secure Record Structure
- Unique ID or QR code for every credential
- Store minimal credential hash (preparing for blockchain)

Database
- PostgreSQL for secure, structured storage
- Tables: universities, students, credentials, verifications, admins
- Option for local hosting for institutions with data sovereignty concerns

Basic Email & SMS Notifications
- Email to university admin when a verification is requested
- SMS notifications for critical alerts (more reliable than email in many EA regions)

Authentication
- Admin login via secure password (Firebase Auth or Auth0 can be used initially)
- 2FA via SMS for enhanced security

üß™ Testing:
- Pilot with 2-3 prominent private universities in Uganda, Kenya, or Tanzania
- Preload sample records and simulate real verification requests
- Test under various internet connectivity scenarios

üìç Phase 2: Transcript Sharing Between Institutions
Timeframe: 2‚Äì3 months (parallel or after MVP launch)
 Goal: Allow verified transcript transfer from one university to another (or to a foreign institution)
‚úÖ Features to Build:
Request Transcript
- A logged-in university user can request a transcript from another institution

Approve & Send Transcript
- Sending university reviews request ‚Üí approves ‚Üí sends digital copy (PDF or generated report)

Transcript Viewer
- Receiving party views the transcript in a secure UI

Verification Workflow
- Each transcript includes QR code or unique ID to cross-check against stored credentials
- Add support for cross-border credential recognition within East African Community
- Compliance with inter-university transfer protocols in East Africa

üìç Phase 3: Blockchain Credential Anchoring
Timeframe: 1‚Äì2 months
 Goal: Add an optional layer of trust for permanent, tamper-proof credentials
‚úÖ Features to Build:
Hash Transcript Data
- Hash key data (student ID, degree, year) into SHA-256

Store on Blockchain
- Use Polygon (or testnet initially) to write hash + credential ID

Verification API
- Compare new hashes with blockchain records for authenticity
- You don‚Äôt need to store the full transcript on-chain‚Äîjust the hash for proof.
- Consider lower-cost blockchain solutions appropriate for developing markets
- Potential partnership with local telecom providers for infrastructure support

üìç Phase 4: Student Portal (Read-Only Access)
Timeframe: 1‚Äì2 months
 Goal: Let students access and share their verified records
‚úÖ Features to Build:
Student Login (email + password or phone)
- View My Credentials
- View their transcript/degree and blockchain status
- Generate Shareable Link / QR Code
- Share with employers/schools (view-only access)
- USSD interface option for feature phone access (widespread in rural East Africa)
- Integration with mobile money platforms for optional premium services

üìç Phase 5: Premium & International Features
Timeframe: Ongoing
 Goal: Monetize the platform and build for global compatibility
‚úÖ Features to Build:
Employer Account (Premium)
- Bulk verification tool
- Export reports, advanced search

Integration with Global Platforms
- API to accept requests from international institutions or credential evaluators

Analytics Dashboard (for institutions)
- View verification stats, usage metrics, fraud alerts

NCHE/UPUA-level Admin Dashboard
- Regional dashboards for associations or regulators
- East African Community (EAC) educational regulatory compliance
- Integration with regional employment platforms
- Cross-border verification for students seeking opportunities within East Africa
- Partnerships with international credential evaluators for global mobility

üì¶ Development Stack Overview
Layer | Recommended Tools
--- | ---
Frontend | React + Tailwind CSS (for admin & public portals) + Progressive Web App features
Backend | Node.js (Express) or Django (Python) with efficient caching for low-bandwidth areas
Database | PostgreSQL (with option for local hosting)
Auth | Firebase Auth or Auth0 with SMS-based 2FA
Blockchain | Polygon SDK (low transaction fees) or consider Cardano (growing in Africa)
Hosting | Vercel for frontend, local or regional hosting options for backend and data
Communication | SendGrid or Firebase email + Africa's SMS gateways (Africas Talking, Twilio)
QR Code | qrcode library or Google Chart API

üß≠ Market-Specific Considerations
- **Data Sovereignty**: East African countries increasingly require educational data to be hosted locally
- **Connectivity Challenges**: Design for low-bandwidth and intermittent connectivity
- **Mobile First**: Prioritize mobile interfaces as smartphone penetration continues to grow
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Build with EAC educational regulatory frameworks in mind
- **Language Support**: Consider English and Swahili interfaces at minimum
- **Cost Sensitivity**: Develop pricing models appropriate for East African educational budgets
- **Trust Building**: Incorporate local educational authorities in verification processes

‚úÖ Next Steps for You
‚úÖ Engage with 2-3 private universities in different East African countries for initial feedback
‚úÖ Connect with East African higher education regulatory bodies for alignment and potential endorsement
‚úÖ Build MVP (Phase 1) with East African use cases as primary design considerations
‚úÖ Conduct user testing with actual administrators from target institutions
‚úÖ Develop offline-first capabilities for areas with connectivity challenges
